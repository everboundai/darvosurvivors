    <title>The Victim's Trajectory: Understanding Covert Narcissistic Abuse</title>
    
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutrality -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as an interactive journey rather than a linear report. It begins with a compassionate introduction. The core of the app is the "Victim's Trajectory," a three-part interactive section (The Target Profile, Abuser's Tactics, The Aftermath) using clickable cards for exploration. The most critical part is the "Synergy of Transformation," an interactive diagram visually linking pre-abuse traits to post-abuse symptoms, which is the central thesis of the source report. This is followed by a "Before & After" radar chart for a powerful visual comparison and an interactive diagram of physiological impacts. This structure was chosen because it breaks down dense information into manageable pieces and allows users to discover the crucial connections between concepts at their own pace, which is more effective for learning and retention than a long, scrolling document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - [The Target Profile & Abuser's Tactics]: Goal: Organize/Inform. Method: Interactive HTML cards. Interaction: Click to reveal details. Justification: Prevents overwhelming the user with text, encourages active exploration.
        - [Synergy of Transformation]: Goal: Show Relationships. Method: Custom interactive diagram (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Click a "Before" trait to see its "After" consequence and read the explanation. Justification: This is the most effective way to communicate the report's core "tragic synergy" concept, making the connection explicit and memorable.
        - [Before & After Profile]: Goal: Compare. Method: Chart.js Radar Chart. Interaction: Buttons to toggle between "Before" and "After" profiles. Justification: Provides a stark, immediate visual representation of the psychological transformation.
        - [Physiological Impact]: Goal: Inform/Organize. Method: Interactive HTML/CSS diagram. Interaction: Hover over body areas to see related symptoms. Justification: More engaging and less clinical than a simple list, connecting symptoms to the physical self.
        - Library/Method: Vanilla JS for all logic, Chart.js for the radar chart, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                Covert narcissistic abuse is a subtle, insidious form of psychological manipulation that often goes unrecognized for years. This interactive experience is designed to illuminate the victim's journey—not as a linear path, but as a complex interplay of vulnerabilities, abusive tactics, and profound after-effects. By exploring these connections, we can foster deeper understanding, awareness, and empathy for survivors.
